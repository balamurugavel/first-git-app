# NAMING CONVENTIONS

This section mentions the naming conventions to be followed by anyone. Also, find few good example names wherever it's appropriate and does follow the naming conventions.

## Publish Profiles

- Please refrain use of CI in publish profile names. CI* publish profile names are reserved for any deployment publish builds. <br>
  e.g. CI Release, CI Stage
  
- Use 'DEV' as part of publish profile names for any local IIS hosting by developers. <br>
  e.g. DEV Debug, DEV Release, STXDEV Debug, STX DEV Release
